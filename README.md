# Description

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The Snake grows longer as it eats food, and the goal is to achieve the highest possible score without colliding with the walls or the Snake's own tail.

# Features

- Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Snake grows longer and increases the score upon eating food.
- Game over when the Snake collides with the walls or its own tail.
- Increasing difficulty levels as the Snake levels up.
